Hi I'm Akbar, just finished my first fullstack project. This project is aimed to teach me about web development 
including it's backend side and the frontend side of the application, with this project i have learned on how to execute CRUD operation, design an API and managing database
based on user request. 

several features that i implement myself:
-Assigned notes to several user at once
-Deleting a user means deleting all notes assignes to the user
-Edit users can also Assign several note to multiple users at once

i have also done debugging process on several things, mainly a problem with status code from the api that are not assigned on time in the frontend code.
I have a lot of fun making this project regardless. i'll be back to learn about more project in the future . Big thanks to Mr. Dave for teaching and guiding me on this project.

(Disclaimer: this project is apart of tutorial that can be viewed at Dave Gray channel on youtube)
